**HERE HE IS!!!!**

**My FIRST, in my opinion, real project. 🙈**

How it all began, endless viewings of “djinni” in the hope of snagging the coveted Offer.
I receive an excellent "Technical Assignment".
Which required React Native, to be honest (I 'felt' it) I didn't like it =(
Well, as expected, I ****** ** it.
But as you can see, this project is here, I am DOING it!!!!

**So why is this my 'FIRST' project. 🧑‍🦳**

Everything is easy and simple my friends, after a long time of working on all my “PET-PROJECTS” (Here is the link to everything -> https://github.com/DimaPidko/My-Pet-Projects-SPA- )
I finally got excited about this work, my friends!!!
What an incredible thrill I get from writing my “Messenger”

**In developing... 🛀**
**STACK:** "JS/TS, React. TailWind, react-forms, react-router-dom, express, mySql"
